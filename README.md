# Rare7
Classifies species into seven forms of rarity of Rabinowitz

# Overview
The Rabinowitz’s method uses three parameters (geographic range, habitat specificity, and population size) to classify rare species. Geographic range is a parameter of regional scale, while the other two are local. Their combination results in seven form of rarity, and in the identification of common species.

# Usage

rareData()

The main function is rareData, basically, this quantifies higher latitudes to quantify the proportion of distribution of a species; maximum abundance of a species and habitat number where species occur.

rarityForms()

The second function uses the output provided by the first function. Then this function classifies the forms of rarity.

# Data format/information

The data input to Rare is a data frame that contains the following structure.
#
'data.frame':	5 obs. of  5 variables:

 $ specie  : Factor w/ 5 levels "sp.1","sp.2",..: 1 2 3 4 5
 
 $ lat     : num  -4.7 -14.7 -14.7 -24.7 -24.7
 
 $ long    : num  -42.9 -39.9 -45.9 -45.1 -45.9
 
 $ NumIndiv: int  2 1 3 1 32
 
 $ habitat : Factor w/ 2 levels "forest","savanna": 2 1 2 1 2
